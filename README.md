## 4. Complete setup/installion/usage
State what a user needs to do when they come to your project.  How do others start using your code or application?
To start using our application one must:
* Create an account.
* Personalize your account in user settings.
* Post or Search rides.
* Bookmark rides you would like to take.

## 5. Known Bugs and Limitations
* Furthest a user can get is booking a ride, however it does not let the driver know.

## 6. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* Drivers know when a user has booked their ride.
* When all seats have been taken remove ride from postings.
* Messages with driver.
